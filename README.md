### Here is the link to the uploaded files on AWS S3

## I have a python file as well as a jupyter notebooks file with the script for uploading files onto AWS in his folder

For the BONUS question, I converted the text file to a CSV using pandas ( code is in the python file) so that it could be loaded to Athena. But for some reason, it kept giving me file empty. The file was definitely a table as seen in notebook. But Athena was not reading the data and I was not able to figure out why. I think I will keep working on that to figure it out. 

### The SQL code would simply be
### SELECT * from Table 
### WHERE value = 2.6
